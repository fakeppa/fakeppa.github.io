#### Description

Can you make a CoreWars warrior that wins?Your opponent is the Imp. The source is available [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/408/imp.red). If you wanted to pit the Imp against himself, you could download the Imp and connect to the CoreWars server like this:`nc saturn.picoctf.net 50813 < imp.red`To get the flag, you must beat the Imp at least once out of the many rounds.
#### Hints
You may be able to find a viable warrior in beginner docs
