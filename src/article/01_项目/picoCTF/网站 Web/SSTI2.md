#### Description

I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! I read about input sanitization, so now I remove any kind of characters that could be a problem :)I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website [here](http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:55351/)!

#### Hints 

1. Server Side Template Injection
2. Why is blacklisting characters a bad idea to sanitize input?
