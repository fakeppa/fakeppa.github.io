#### Description

Can you figure out what is in the `eax` register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: `picoCTF{n}` where `n` is the contents of the `eax` register in the decimal number base. If the answer was `0x11` your flag would be `picoCTF{17}`.Download the assembly dump [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/511/disassembler-dump0_d.txt).
#### Hints
- Don't tell anyone I told you this, but you can solve this problem without understanding the compare/jump relationship.
- Of course, if you're really good, you'll only need one attempt to solve this problem.
