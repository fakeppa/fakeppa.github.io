#### Description

Can you figure out what is in the `eax` register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: `picoCTF{n}` where `n` is the contents of the `eax` register in the decimal number base. If the answer was `0x11` your flag would be `picoCTF{17}`.Download the assembly dump [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/530/disassembler-dump0_c.txt).
#### Hints
Not everything in this disassembly listing is optimal.
